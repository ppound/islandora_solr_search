- based on Solr version, use edismax by default for simple search.
- create import/export functionality

- bug when reordering field and then clicking configure
- but when changing solr url and then using the autocomplete.
- throw warning if adding a sort field isn't sortable

- some bugs in modal dialog resizing (facets)
- clean up table headers
- create doxygen code + wrapper doxygen
- clean up code (run through coder)

- when populating fields, if a solr field has a label in another field, maybe the default label can be the one already filled out? If the current one is empty still?
- pressing 'enter' on 'add field' results in errors and no js callback

- make labels translatable: http://drupal.org/node/1114010

- separate preparing results from display
- result permissions only enforced on default display
- we could save us some code by storing the primary display settings in a DB table
- add luke check for date fields (breaks if not)
- more user friendly controls + advanced option
- don't prepopulate advanced search field if dropdown does not equal the solr field in url

- port from D6 to D7:
-- limit search results (block)
-- look for details (permissions, string handling, css, etc..)
-- rss feed + config

Normal Priority
---------------

- Try to fix popup resizing.
- rename 'solr_field_settings' to 'settings'
- really need to clean IslandoraSolrResults. All of it, but especially facets.
- use libraries module for flot
- fix snippet field highlighting
- Facet settings: add checkbox to display facet as a separate block. Can be nice for sliders to display in the content top or bottom.
- improve settings display. add little icon with settings in tooltip? misc/message-16-help.png
- split out highlighting true by default. Don't include unless at least one field is given.
- add ability to add permission callback or permission id to solr display profiles
- add a check to see if the context is the search results page. Currently we
check if IslandoraSolrQueryProcessor::display is set, which is not ideal.
- update hook_help functions
- add a parameter to the luke function to return a single document.
- check if spaces could be replaced by + or %20 , which would simplify some functions (splitting strings)
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#sort
- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- table display works but should be rendered through a template file.
- add ajax_command_changed() to the vertical tabs to show something has changed.
- add watchdog messages on error.
- on query without filter parameters the delete link adds a ? or &
- some snippets of markup could go in theme functions

Low Priority
------------

- update README.txt
- tabledrag should update the table with ajax.
- hook_alter instead of module invoke all for object manipulation
- provide integration with display suite
- expose result limit controls
- put object url's in one variable?
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)
